method overloading 
when in the same class, same name have different parameters types or numbers 

example of overloading: 

void func() {

}

void func(int a) {

}

void func(double a) 
{

}

void func(int a, double b) {

}

//

void func(int a)  and int func(int a)  are not overloaded, as same number and type of parameter, even if return type is differemt 
may or may not have different return type 

java first looks for exact match in terms of type and number of arguments but if not 
it does automatic type conversion but not in the reverse 
eg sending int to double can do, but double sent to int not possible, lossy error
